        <h2>What is this website about?</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>
        The 2014 Indonesian presidential elections in july has been a tight race between two
        candidates:
        Prabowo Subianto and Joko Widodo. For the first time in history the national election
        commission
        KPU has <a target="_blank" href="http://pilpres2014.kpu.go.id/c1.php">published </a>
        scans of all (around 500.000) vote tallying forms.<br/>
        Because of this, in principle, anybody can verify the official results. But who is willing
        or able to do this? That is why we decided to download all the forms and try to count
        them using a computer. This attempt was cut short for two reasons. <br/>
        The <em>first</em> being that it turned that there were too many forms that were not filled
        out in the standard way. To train the computer to handle all of these cases is too difficult. <br/>
        </p>
        <div ng-controller="FormCarouselController" class="formCarousel thumbnail">
            <div carousel interval="5000">
                <div slide ng-repeat="slide in slides" active="slide.active">
                    <img ng-src="{{slide.image}}" style="margin: auto;">

                    <div class="carousel-caption">
                        <p>{{slide.text}}</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="caption">Examples of problematic forms</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            The <em>second</em> reason was that we heard about the great
            <a href="http://www.kawalpemilu.org/">kawal pemilu</a> initiative that has now achieved
            through crowd-sourcing, exactly what have attemped to do automatically.
        </p>
        <h3>The purpose</h3>
        <p>
            So currently there is no great need for an additional verification
            of the C1 form based count. <br/>
            However, for coming elections this software could improve both the <em>quality</em> and
            <em>speed</em>
            of the manual verification. <br/>
        </p>
        <h5>Quality</h5>

        <p>The number of C1 forms reported there as problematic is more than 5% for some provinces.
            Kawal C1 can improve this situation. By detecting problems in the form (unclear
            handwriting,
            calculation errors, missing witness signatures, etc.) and giving the uploader the
            opportunity to type in the totals.</p>
        <h5>Speed</h5>

        <p>
            The manual counting teams can focus their efforts on forms that have been flagged by
            kawal C1
            as problematic. The numbers of forms that are not problematic will immediately be
            available.
