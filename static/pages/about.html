    <h3>Why do we need kawal C1 if we have KPU and kawal pemilu?</h3>

    <p>
        This is a good question. Because of the fantastic <a href="http://www.kawalpemilu.org/">kawal
        pemilu</a>
        crowd-sourcing initiative, there is no great need for an additional automated verification
        of the C1 based count. <br/>
        However, for coming elections this software could improve both the <em>quality</em> and <em>speed</em>
        of the manual verification. <br/>
    </p>
    <h5>Quality</h5>

    <p>The number of C1 forms reported there as problematic is more than 5% for some provinces.
        Kawal C1 can improve this situation. By detecting problems in the form (unclear handwriting,
        calculation errors, missing witness signatures, etc.) and giving the uploader the
        opportunity to type in the totals.</p>
    <h5>Speed</h5>
    <p>
        The manual counting teams can focus their efforts on forms that have been flagged by kawal C1
        as problematic. The numbers of forms that are not problematic will immediately be available.
    </p>


    <h3>What is the accuracy of the software?</h3>

    <p>
        This is something we cannot give reliable numbers on yet. This website should be seen as a
        proof of concept.
        However, since all C1 forms and both the official KPU and <i>kawal pemilu</i> resuls are
        openly available,
        it will be relatively easy to test and improve the accuracy. This our top priority now.
    </p>

    <h3>Does this software only work for pilpres 2014 C1 forms?</h3>

    <p>
        At the moment yes. But it will not be difficult to configure it for other forms like the
        ones that are used for local elections for example.
    </p>

    <h3>Who can use this software?</h3>

    <p>
        This software is completely <a href="https://github.com/sjappelodorus/verifikatorc1"
                                       target="_blank">open source</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Is it not better to trust humans than to trust a computer?</h3>

    <p>
        Yes. This software is only a tool to improve human verification.
